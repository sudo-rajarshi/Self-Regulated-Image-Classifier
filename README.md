* A web-based system that creates classification models by just taking the dataset from the user side.
* The user need not to write a single of code for model creation purpose.
* The system is packed with all essential features for parameters \& hyper-parameters tunning and also incorporates transfer learning functionality.
* Technology used: Python3, Tensorflow, Keras, Open-CV, Flask

## Run in own machine:
* `git clone https://github.com/AI-Testament/SRIC-web.git` 
* `cd SRIC-web`
* `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
* `python3 app.py`
